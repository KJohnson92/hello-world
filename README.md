# hello-world
My first repository where I can store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others. Repositories can contain folders, files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets. Git Hub also recommend including a README, which is a file that describes the information about my project.
Hi Other Humans!

My name is Kisha and I'm a New York City native. I have friends who know how to code and I have always found it interesting. I am now trying to build my own website and thought it would be great if I could actually do the website myself. I have a difficult time emotionally with feeling like I'm not smart enough sometimes and thought this would be a great way to boost my self esteem. I have a difficult time trying to figure out how to use my Iphone so I really hope I'm able to make myself proud. I'm looking forward to seeing and being apart of your own journey in code. XO
